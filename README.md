Code of the Paper “TrafficBT: Advancing Pre-trained Language Models for Network Traffic Classification with Multimodal Traffic Representations”

PyTorch 2.1.2 NVIDIA A800（4090 is OK）

The project is organized into three main directories:
- `data_preprocess/` — for data preprocessing.
- `pre_training/` — for pre-training.
- `fine_tuning/` — for fine-tuning.

Detailed instructions for code usage can be found in the `README` files within each directory.
